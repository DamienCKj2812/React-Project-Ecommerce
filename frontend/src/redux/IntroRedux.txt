-------------------------------------- STORE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Redux, the store is a crucial part of the state management architecture. It's a JavaScript object that holds the entire state tree of your application. 
The state represents the current state of your application at any given point in time. 
Imagine your application's data is like a big box containing everything it needs to rememberâ€”like user information, preferences, and more. That big box is the Redux store.

1. Keeper of Data: The store is where all the important information about your application is stored, like the current user, what they're doing, and any other data your app needs.

2. One Big Box: Instead of having bits of information scattered around your app, Redux says, "Let's put everything in one big box." 
                This makes it easier to manage and keep track of what's going on.

3. Reading from the Box: Different parts of your app can look into the big box to see what's inside. 
                         This helps components know what the current situation is without directly talking to each other.

4. Changing the Box: If something needs to change in your app (like the user logging in), you don't just change the box directly. 
                     Instead, you create a "To-Do" note (an action) and give it to the box (dispatch the action). The box then knows what needs to be updated and how.

5. Rule Keeper: The store has rules (reducers) about how to handle each "To-Do" note (action). 
                It looks at the note, decides what needs to change in the big box, and makes the changes following those rules.

6. Everyone Agrees: By using this big box and following the rules, your app stays organized and predictable. \
                    Everyone knows where to look for information, and changes are made in a consistent way.

So, in simple terms, think of the Redux store as a big box that holds all the important details about your app. 
It helps different parts of your app communicate, keeps everything organized, and ensures that changes happen in a controlled and predictable manner.




-------------------------------------- REDUCER (SIMILAR TO EVENT HANLING WHICH REACT WITH THE ACTION)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reducer receives the current state and an action as arguments. It then uses the information from the action to determine how the state should be updated. 
Instead of directly modifying the current state, the reducer returns a new state object that reflects the changes.

Simple example of reducer:
const initialState = {
  count: 0
};

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default counterReducer;


Here's a breakdown of the typical flow:

1. The Redux store is created with an initial state and a reducer.

2. When an action is dispatched in the application, the Redux store calls the reducer function with the current state and the action.

3. Inside the reducer, a switch statement or some other logic is used to determine how the state should change based on the action type.

4. The reducer returns a new state object that represents the updated state of the application.

5. The Redux store then replaces the current state with the newly returned state.

-------------------------------------- SLICE (grouping together related actions, action creators, and a reducer into a cohesive unit.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Redux, a "slice" refers to a portion of the Redux state that is managed by a specific reducer. 
It is a concept associated with the use of the createSlice function from the Redux Toolkit, which is a set of tools and utilities aimed at simplifying Redux-related tasks.

A slice typically consists of the following:

Reducer: A function that specifies how the slice's state changes in response to actions. This reducer is created using the createSlice function.

Actions: Action creators are automatically generated for the reducer, thanks to createSlice. These actions are specific to the slice and can be dispatched to trigger state changes.

Selectors: Functions that extract specific pieces of the state from the Redux store. Selectors make it easier to access and use the state data related to the slice.

Here's an example of creating a slice using createSlice:


import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    value: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.counter.value;
export default counterSlice.reducer;


In this example:

The createSlice function is used to create a slice named 'counter'. It takes an initial state, a set of reducer functions, and some additional options.

The reducers field in the configuration object contains functions for handling specific actions. These functions directly modify the state using immer, 
a library that enables more convenient updates to immutable data structures.

The createSlice function generates action creators (e.g., increment and decrement) and a reducer, and you can export and use them in your application.

The selectCounterValue selector is also defined to easily access the counter value from the state.

Using slices can help organize your Redux code by grouping related actions, reducers, and selectors together. Redux Toolkit's createSlice is a convenient tool for creating slices, 
as it automatically generates actions and simplifies the process of defining reducers.


-------------------------------------- ACTION (SIMILAR TO EVENT WHICH REACT WITH THE DISPATCH) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Redux, an action is a plain JavaScript object that describes an event or intention to change the state. Actions are the only way to send data to the Redux store. 
They have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed and may contain additional data, 
commonly referred to as the "payload," which carries information needed to update the state.

Here is a simple example of an action:

const incrementAction = {
  type: 'INCREMENT',
  payload: {
    amount: 1,
  },
};
In this example:

type is a string that describes the type of action. It's typically defined as an uppercase string constant, and it represents the action that will be performed.

payload is an optional property that contains any additional data needed to update the state. It can be any valid JavaScript value, such as a number, string, object, etc.

Actions are typically created using action creator functions to ensure consistency and reusability. Here's an example of an action creator:

const increment = (amount) => {
  return {
    type: 'INCREMENT',
    payload: {
      amount,
    },
  };
};
In this case, the increment action creator takes an amount parameter and returns an action object with the specified type and payload.

To update the Redux store, actions must be dispatched. Dispatching an action is the process of sending it to the Redux store, 
triggering the corresponding reducer to update the state. This is typically done using the dispatch function provided by the Redux store:

store.dispatch(increment(1));

In this example, the increment action creator is called with an amount of 1, and the resulting action is dispatched to the Redux store.

In summary, actions in Redux are simple objects that represent events or intentions to change the state. 
They have a type property to describe the action and may include additional data in the payload. Action creators are functions that create and return action objects, making it easier to manage and dispatch actions in your application.


-------------------------------------- PAYLOAD (ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF A ACTION) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of Redux actions, the term "payload" refers to the additional data that is included with the action. 
It is the part of the action object that provides information or values necessary for the reducer to carry out the intended state change.

Here's a breakdown of the common components of a Redux action object:

type: A string that describes the type of action being performed. It is a required field and is used by the reducer to determine how to update the state.

payload: An optional property that contains any additional data associated with the action. 
The payload provides context or information needed to update the state. The structure of the payload can vary based on the requirements of your application.

Here's an example of an action with a payload:

const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Learn Redux',
    completed: false,
  },
};
In this example, the payload property contains an object with information about a todo item. When the 'ADD_TODO' action is dispatched, 
the reducer can use the data in the payload to update the state accordingly, such as adding a new todo item to the list.

Including a payload in actions allows for flexibility and customization, enabling actions to carry relevant data to the reducers for precise state updates. 
Keep in mind that while the type property is mandatory and standardized, the payload structure is application-specific and depends on the needs of your particular use case.


In simpler terms:

Action: An action is like a message that tells Redux what should change in the state.

Payload: The payload is additional information that comes with the message. It's the details or data needed to make the change correctly.

Imagine you're giving directions to someone:

Type (like action type): "Go to the store."

Payload (like action payload): "Buy a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread."

In this analogy, "Go to the store" is like the action, and "Buy a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread" is like the payload â€“ the specific details or instructions needed to carry out the action correctly. Similarly, in Redux, actions have a type (what to do) and a payload (additional details on how to do it).



-------------------------------------- DISPATCH (REQUEST FROM THE USER (LIKE A BUTTON CLICKED))---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Redux, dispatching refers to the process of sending an action to the Redux store. 
The dispatch function is a method provided by the Redux store that allows you to send actions to the store, triggering the state changes defined by the reducers.

Here's a basic overview of how dispatching works in Redux:

1. Action Creation: First, you create an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object with a type property that describes the type of action and, optionally, 
a payload property that contains additional data.

const incrementAction = {
  type: 'INCREMENT',
  payload: {
    amount: 1,
  },
};

2. Dispatching: You use the dispatch function to send the action to the Redux store.

store.dispatch(incrementAction);

The dispatch function is part of the store and is responsible for triggering the state change based on the action.

3. Reducer Execution: When an action is dispatched, it is passed to the reducers. Reducers are functions that specify how the state should change in response to different action types.

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + action.payload.amount };
    // Other cases for different action types
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

4. State Update: The reducer processes the action and returns a new state. The Redux store then updates its state with the newly returned state.


-------------------------------------- DATA FLOW ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. User Interaction:

The user interacts with the application, for example, by clicking a button or selecting an option.

2. Action Creation:

In response to the user interaction, you create an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened. 
It has a type property indicating the type of action and, optionally, a payload with additional data.

const userClickedButtonAction = {
  type: 'BUTTON_CLICK',
  payload: {
    option: 'someValue',
  },
};

3. Dispatching:

You dispatch the action to the Redux store using the dispatch method. This is like sending a message to Redux saying, "Hey, something happened in the app, and here are the details."

store.dispatch(userClickedButtonAction);

4. Reducer Execution:

The action is received by the reducer. Reducers are functions that specify how the state should change in response to different action types.

const buttonClickReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'BUTTON_CLICK':
      // Perform some logic based on action.payload
      return newState;
    // Handle other cases if needed
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

5. State Update:

The reducer processes the action and returns a new state. The Redux store updates its state with the newly returned state.

6. Subscribe to State Changes:

If you have subscribed to the store (using subscribe), the subscribed callback function is called whenever the state changes. This is where you can update your UI or perform any side effects.

const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('State changed:', store.getState());
  // Update UI or perform other actions based on the state change
});

7. Unsubscribe (Optional):

If you no longer need to listen to state changes (for example, when a component is unmounted), you can unsubscribe to avoid unnecessary updates.

unsubscribe();
So, in summary, the process involves the user interacting with the application, creating and dispatching actions, reducers processing actions and updating the state, and subscribed callbacks being invoked to respond to state changes. 
This cycle ensures a predictable and controlled flow of data in a Redux application.
















-------------------------------------- EXAMPLE OF FLOW FOR CREATING REDUX ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More complex example related to a todo list application. In this case, we'll have multiple actions and a more intricate state structure:

Step 1: Define the State Shape
const initialState = {
  todos: [],
};


Step 2: Create Actions
// Action types
const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
const TOGGLE_TODO = 'TOGGLE_TODO';
const REMOVE_TODO = 'REMOVE_TODO';

// Action creators
const addTodo = (text) => ({ type: ADD_TODO, 
                             payload: { text } });

const toggleTodo = (id) => ({ type: TOGGLE_TODO, 
                              payload: { id } });

const removeTodo = (id) => ({ type: REMOVE_TODO, 
                              payload: { id } });


Step 3: Write Reducers
// Reducer function for handling todos
const todosReducer = (state = initialState.todos, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return [...state, { id: Date.now(), text: action.payload.text, completed: false }];

    case TOGGLE_TODO:
      return state.map(todo =>
        todo.id === action.payload.id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      );

    case REMOVE_TODO:
      return state.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload.id);

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Combine reducers if needed
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer,
});


Step 4: Create the Redux Store
const store = createStore(rootReducer);


Step 5: Dispatch Actions
// Dispatching actions
store.dispatch(addTodo('Learn Redux'));
store.dispatch(toggleTodo(1));
store.dispatch(removeTodo(1));


Step 6: Subscribe to State Changes
// Subscribe to state changes
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('Current state:', store.getState());
});


In this example:

The state shape includes an array of todos, each with an id, text, and completed property.

Three action types (ADD_TODO, TOGGLE_TODO, REMOVE_TODO) and corresponding action creators are defined.

The todosReducer handles these actions to update the state based on the action type.

The rootReducer combines all reducers, even if there's only one in this example.

The store is created using createStore(rootReducer).

Actions are dispatched to modify the state.

The state changes are logged when subscribing to the store.

This example demonstrates a more realistic scenario where state changes involve complex data structures (todos with different properties), multiple actions, and a more modular structure with action types, creators, and reducers.


-------------------------------------- UTILITY FEATURE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------- COMBINE REDUCER ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
combineReducers is a utility that simplifies the process of creating a root reducer for your Redux store when you have multiple slices of state, each managed by its own reducer. 
It provides a convenient way to organize and structure your Redux code, making it more modular and maintainable.

---------- With Slice -------------
import { createSlice, combineReducers, createStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
});

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState: { username: '', loggedIn: false },
  reducers: {
    login: (state) => {
      state.loggedIn = true;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.loggedIn = false;
    },
  },
});

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterSlice.reducer,
  user: userSlice.reducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);



---------- Without Slice -------------
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';

const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const userReducer = (state = { username: '', loggedIn: false }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return { ...state, loggedIn: true };
    case 'LOGOUT':
      return { ...state, loggedIn: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  user: userReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
In this example, the rootReducer combines two slices: counter and user, each managed by its respective reducer function. This combined reducer is then used to create the Redux store.

In summary, combineReducers is a utility function in Redux that facilitates the composition of multiple reducers into a single, manageable root reducer. It helps organize your code when dealing with different slices of the state in a larger Redux application.
